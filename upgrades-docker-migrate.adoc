While `taiga-docker` has been a pretty successful way for many people to have a Taiga self-hosted, the Taiga team receives a bunch of questions about the docker configuration. We have released a new `taiga-docker` version with the main settings based in an `.env` file. The main goal behind this change is to make it way easier to have a basic Taiga up and running.

For those of you who already have a self-hosted Taiga running with docker, this tutorial will guide you through the steps of the migration.

[NOTE]
.Upgrade to Docker Compose V2
====
Taiga uses the new Docker Compose V2, because from the end of June 2023 Compose V1 wonâ€™t be supported anymore.

Please ensure you have installed docker **version 19.03.0+**. Now you should be able to use `docker compose` instead of the old `docker-compose` command.

== Summary

If you are familiar with docker and docker compose, this is the sensible summary:

- save the modifications made in the `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose-inits.yml` files
- update the repository `taiga-docker`
- add the configuration values to the `.env` file
- add the link:setup-production.html#customization[customization values] to the `docker-compose.yml` file
- launch all services again

That's it!

== Step by step

If you are not so familiar with docker or git, these are the comprehensive steps.

=== Get and save your current configurations

Make sure to save all the modifications to the `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose-inits.yml` files. Tipically, you'll be using the file in the repository, so a `git diff` will show you all the modifications.

If you have any other modification, trace them as well.

=== Update the repository

Download the new version with `git fetch && git reset --hard origin/main`. Make sure you have now an `.env` file.

=== Add the configuration values to the `.env` file

Open the `.env` file and fill the values with the ones you stored previously:

- Taiga URL
- Taiga secret key
- Postgres connection
- Email configuration
- RabbitMQ configuration
- Attachments' token expiration
- Enable telemetry: we use this anonymous telemetry to improve Taiga. You may want to enable this to help us shape future Taiga.

=== Add the customization values to the `docker-file.yml` file

link:setup-production.html#customization[Customizations] are still in the `docker-compose.yml` file, for instance:

- GitLab Auth
- GitHub Importer

=== Launch Taiga again

Run `docker compose up -d` (you may have a slightly different way for this command) and check every service is up and running.
