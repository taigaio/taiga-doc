[[themes]]
== Themes

Taiga support themes: it allows customizing app colors and overwriting or adding CSS to any part of Taiga.

Duplicate the folder `taiga` (or another theme) under `/app/themes` and rename it with the theme name.

You'll find two files inside:

* `variables.scss` - to override sass variables, fonts, mixins helpers, etc.

* `custom.scss` - to override any defined Taiga style for any module or layout.

Remember, the file `variables.scss` should only contain sass declarations that do not generate code by themselves (like variables or mixins).

If you need to override a style and generate some new CSS, you should do it in `custom.scss`.

Please, check the default Taiga theme to understand how these files work properly.

Add the theme to the theme array in `dist/conf.json`.

Deploy your code

[source]
----
gulp deploy
----

After that, you should be able to update your theme from your user profile in your user settings.

If you create public themes, please share it with the community. Share the link in social media and ping link:http://twitter.com/taigaio/[@taigaio].
