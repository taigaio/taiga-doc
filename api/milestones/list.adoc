To list milestones send a GET request with the following parameters:

include::../generated/milestones-list-cmd.adoc[]

The HTTP response is a 200 OK and the response body is a JSON list of link:#object-milestone-detail[milestone detail objects]

The results can be filtered using the following parameters:

- *project*: project ID
- *closed*: `true` to get only closed milestones or `false` to get only opened ones.

include::../generated/milestones-filtered-list-cmd.adoc[]

[NOTE]
===============================
When you filter milestones by project ID (`/api/v1/milestones?project=_<projectID>_`) the response has two new headers:

- `*Taiga-Info-Total-Opened-Milestones*`: the numer of opened milestones for this project.
- `*Taiga-Info-Total-Closed-Milestones*`: the numer of closed milestones for this project.
